# 🧮 BMI Calculator

---

## 📝 Summary

This is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator built in a Jupyter Notebook using Python. It takes the user's height and weight as input, calculates the BMI, and categorizes the result (e.g. underweight, normal, overweight, obese).

---

## 🔧 What I Did

- Collected user input for height (in cm) and weight (in kg)
- Applied the BMI formula to compute the index
- Used conditional statements to categorize the result
- Displayed the result in a clear, friendly format

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to use `input()` and convert data types in Python
- How to structure a basic Python script in Jupyter Notebook
- How to use `if/elif/else` to control program logic
- How to print clean output for users

---

## ✅ Result

The notebook successfully calculates BMI for any given input and classifies it accurately based on standard BMI categories.

## 🌱 Future Improvements

- Add input validation to prevent invalid values (e.g. negative numbers, non-numeric input)
- Visualize BMI categories with a chart (matplotlib or seaborn)
- Build a web-based interface using **Streamlit** or **Tkinter**
- Support both metric and imperial units
